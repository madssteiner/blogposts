# Ubuntu FTP Server using vsftpd

Welcome to my very first blog post! As this is my first post please let me know if any mistakes were made. Feel fre to contact me at mkr@kodeklubben.dk. 

By the end og this post you would have an up and running local ftp server with virtual users accessing it. In the future i would provide a blog post about making the ftp server accessible from a public domain or ip address.
